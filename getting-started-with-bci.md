# Getting Started with BCI

### &#x20;What is EEG?

**Electroencephalography (EEG)** is a non-invasive technique used to record the brain's electrical activity through electrodes placed on the scalp. It captures the summed electrical signals produced by neuronal firing, especially from the cerebral cortex.

### How EEG Works (Brief)

* The brain‚Äôs neurons communicate via **electrical impulses**.
* When large groups of neurons fire in synchrony, their combined activity can be detected as **brain waves**.
* EEG devices measure these voltage fluctuations in the microvolt range (¬µV), using **electrodes** typically arranged according to the **10-20 international system**.

***

### Why EEG Matters for BCI

* It's **affordable**, **portable**, and **non-invasive**, making it perfect for practical brain-computer interface projects.
* Unlike MRI or MEG, EEG allows **real-time** signal processing ‚Äî essential for applications like controlling a robotic arm or triggering a command based on thought.

**EEG** is the most commonly used technique in BCIs due to its portability and affordability, there are several other devices and methods ‚Äî each with its own advantages and limitations.

A **channel** in EEG refers to **one independent electrical signal path** from a specific electrode (or pair of electrodes) placed on the scalp to the recording system.

> **Each channel = one measurement of brain activity from one location.**

#### üß™ How It Works Technically

* Electrodes are placed at various points on the scalp (e.g., Fp1, Cz, O2 ‚Äî following the **10‚Äì20 international system**).
* Each electrode picks up voltage fluctuations caused by **neural activity underneath it**.
* The EEG amplifier records these voltages ‚Äî **one per channel**.
* Some devices record **absolute voltages**; others record **differentials** between pairs of electrodes.

### üéØ How to Find the Exact Spot for EEG Electrode Placement

You use the **10‚Äì20 International Electrode Placement System**, which maps electrode locations using **percentages of head size** ‚Äî not fixed distances ‚Äî making it universal across head shapes.

***

#### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Process

**1. Measure the Head**

Using a soft measuring tape:

* **Nasion ‚Üí Inion** (front to back)
* **Left preauricular ‚Üí right preauricular point** (ear to ear across the top)
* **Circumference** of the head (optional, for reference)

**2. Calculate 10% and 20% Points**

* Mark 10% from each end, then 20%, 20%, 20%, and 10% again
* Where these points intersect becomes the electrode position:
  * e.g., **Cz** is the midpoint between nasion-inion and ear-to-ear

**3. Use a Cap (Optional)**

Many EEG caps (like those from OpenBCI or Emotiv) are pre-marked with positions:

* Fp1, Fp2
* F3, F4
* C3, Cz, C4
* P3, P4
* O1, O2

> These match the **standard neuroanatomical lobes**: Frontal, Central, Parietal, Occipital, etc.

***

#### üß† What If You Miss the Spot?

**üîª Small Error (within 1‚Äì2 cm):**

* Usually tolerable in consumer BCI devices
* Might cause **reduced signal quality** or misclassification (e.g., left motor vs right motor imagery)
* Noise filtering and machine learning can sometimes compensate

**üö´ Large Error or Misalignment:**

* Can lead to **wrong signals or lower accuracy**
* BCI tasks like SSVEP, motor imagery, or P300 detection may **fail entirely**
* Bad placement can result in:
  * Cross-talk from wrong brain regions
  * Missed event-related potentials
  * Muscle artifact dominance
