# ðŸ§  Before Getting Started

### Why This Book Exists

Brainâ€“Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are no longer science fiction.\
They are real, affordable, and programmable â€” and now, you can build one.

This book isnâ€™t just about blinking to control a computer or imagining movement to drive a robot. Itâ€™s about something deeper:

> ðŸ§  Giving your thoughts the ability to **interact with the world**.

Whether you're a curious student, a hardware tinkerer, a neuroscientist stepping into coding, or just someone fascinated by the mind-machine frontier â€” this book is for you.

***

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

Through 5 practical projects, you will:

* Connect EEG headsets to your computer
* Detect eye blinks as control inputs
* Use mental imagery to move cursors or machines
* Train a focus visualizer based on real-time attention
* Build a robot arm that responds to imagined movement

> You donâ€™t need to be a neuroscientist. You donâ€™t even need to be a programmer â€” as long as youâ€™re willing to **follow instructions and try things**.

Every chapter explains:

* What the project does
* What brain signal youâ€™re using
* How to wire it all together
* And what code to run â€” no fluff

***

### What This Book Is Not

This is not a neuroscience textbook.\
It will not dive deep into brain anatomy or theoretical signal models.

Instead, itâ€™s a **builderâ€™s guide**. Youâ€™ll learn by doing.

If you want to _feel_ how BCI works in your hands, your IDE, and eventually your own brainwaves â€” this is the place to start.

***

### How to Use This Book

You can read it cover to cover, or skip straight to a project that excites you.

Each project is self-contained, but they build on each other in complexity. If youâ€™re new to BCI, start from Chapter 1 and work forward.

All you need:

* A basic EEG headset (like OpenBCI Ganglion or NeuroSky)
* A Python environment on your laptop
* Curiosity and patience

### One Final Note Before You Begin

This isnâ€™t about creating perfect systems â€” itâ€™s about exploring something powerful, strange, and often magical: **the bridge between your brain and technology**.

So when it gets frustrating (and it will), remember:

> Youâ€™re not just learning code.\
> Youâ€™re learning how to speak machine in the language of thought.

Letâ€™s begin.
